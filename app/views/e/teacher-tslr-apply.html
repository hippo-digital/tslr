      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">You will need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your teacher reference number – you can get this from your school, the certificate you got when you qualified as a teacher or from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/individual-teacher-records-information-for-teachers#contact">teacher qualifications helpdesk</a></li>
        <li>your National Insurance number</li>
        <li>the total amount of student loan payments made through your school wages in the last tax year – you can find this on your payslips</li>
        <li>sign in details for ‘Verify’ (the government’s secure way of proving who you are) – if you do not have a Verify account, you will need your passport or photocard driving licence to sign up</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">We'll check your information</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">After you send your claim, we’ll ask your school to confirm:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>that you worked there in the last tax year</li>
        <li>how much student loan you paid back through your teaching wages during that time</li>
        <li>that you spent most of your time teaching 11 to 16 year olds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you worked at a state-funded school or academy, we'll also check that you taught one of the qualifying subjects for most of your time there.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">You've worked at more than one school</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you've worked at more than one school since {{ globals.tax_year.start_date }}, make a claim for each school separately.</p>
